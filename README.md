# Autonomous UAV Navigation in GPS-Denied Environments

## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of autonomous navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in complex, GPS-denied environments. Traditional UAV systems heavily rely on GPS for localization, making them unsuitable for indoor, underground, or urban canyon scenarios where signals are weak or unavailable. This system develops an advanced UAV solution that integrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and robust path planning techniques to enable truly autonomous operation in such challenging conditions.

Beyond basic navigation, the system incorporates object detection capabilities, allowing the UAV to identify and interact with its surroundings. This combination of technologies makes the system highly applicable to critical real-world applications such as search and rescue operations, disaster response, and environmental monitoring, where human intervention is often dangerous or impossible.
